            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SHORT HISTORICAL ACCOUNT TOUCHING THE Succession of the Crown.</head>
            <p>IN the Heptarchy, there was no fixt Hereditary Right; one King tripping up the heels of another, as he had power, till one got all.</p>
            <p>Afterward no fixt Hereditary Right; for <hi>Athelstan,</hi> the Great King, was a <hi>Bastard;</hi> and so were several others; who by their Courage and Policy, got the Crown; so that a Law was made, under the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchy, <hi>de Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione Regnam,</hi> that directed the Election of Kings, prohibiting <hi>Bastards</hi> to be Elected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward the Confessor</hi> was not King, <hi>Jure haereditario.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the First (called the <hi>Conqueror</hi>) had no Right, but from the peoples Election.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Ruffus</hi> was Elected against the Right of his Elder Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the First came in by the same way.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Stephen</hi> was Elected, <hi>a Clero &amp; Populo,</hi> and Confirmed by the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Second came in by consent; yet he had no Hereditary Right, for his Mother was Living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the First was charged before God and Men, by the Archbishop, upon his Coronation, that he should not presume to take the Crown, unless he resolved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to observe the Laws.</p>
            <p>King <hi>John,</hi> his Brother, because his Elder Brothers Son was a Foreigner, was Elected <hi>a Clero &amp; Populo,</hi> and being Divorced from his Wife, by his new Queen he had <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Third was Confirmed, and Settled in the Kingdom, by the General Election of the People; and in his Life time, the Nation was sworn to the Succession of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, before he went to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the First being out of <hi>England,</hi> by the Consent of Lords and Commons was Declared King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Second being mislead, and relying too much upon his Favourites, was Depose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and his Son was Declared King in his Life time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, for his evil Government, had the Fate of the Second <hi>Edward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth came in by Election of the People, to whom Succeeded <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, in whose time <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> claimed the Crown; and an Act of Parliament was made, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth should enjoy the Crown for his Life, and the said Duke after him; after which, King <hi>Henry</hi> raises an Army, by Assistance of Queen and Prince; and at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> in Battel, kills the Duke; for which, 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. they were all, by Act of Parliament, Attainted of Treason; and one principal Reason thereof, was, for that the Duke being Declared Heir to the Crown, after <hi>Henry,</hi> by Act of Parliament, they had killed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth enters the Stage, and leaves <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. to Succeed, to whom Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, Confirmed King by Act of Parliament, upon Two <hi>Reasons: First,</hi> That by reason of a Precontract of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth, his Eldest Son, and all his other Children were Bastards. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that the Son of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> second Brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, had no Right, because the Duke was Attainted of Treason, by a Parliament of <hi>Ed.</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh comes in, but had no Title; <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Daughter was then living: <hi>Secondly,</hi> His own Mother, the Countess of <hi>Richmond,</hi> was then living.</p>
            <p>After him, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth wore the Crown, who could have no Title by the Father; in his time the Succession of the Crown was limited several times, and the whole Nation sworn to the observance.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> Declared, That the Parliament had a power to bind the Succession, which was Declared to be Law by 13 <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was Declared a <hi>Bastard;</hi> and by virtue of an Act of Parliament, of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, she Succeeded; which Act being Repealed in the First of her Reign, and the Crown being. Limitted otherwise by Parliament, all the Limitations of the Crown in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign were avoided; so that</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was Declared a <hi>Bastard,</hi> by Act of Parliament in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, and Limitted to Succeed, in another Act in his time, and that Act Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> became Queen in the force of her own Act of Parliament, which Declares her Lawful Queen.</p>
            <p>The Crown was entail'd in <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; again, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth; again, in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third; again, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; thrice in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
            <p>And upon the Marriage of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> both the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were entailed; whereby it was provided, that of the several Children to be Begotten upon the Queen, one was to have the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> another <hi>Spain,</hi> another the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> the Articles of Marriage to this purpose, were Confirmed by Act of Parliament, and the Pope's Bull.</p>
            <p>So that it was agreed by the States of both Kingdoms, and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and therefore, probably, the Universal Opinion of the great Men of that Age; That Kings and Sovereign Princes, with the consent of their States, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
